# Changelog

This changelog documents all notable user-facing changes of VAST.

Every entry has a category for which we use the following visual abbreviations:

- 🎁 = feature
- 🔄 = change
- 🐞 = bugfix

## [Unreleased]

- 🎁 Added *Apache Arrow* as new export format. This allows users to export
  query results as Apache Arrow record batches for processing the results
  downstream, e.g., in Python or Spark.
  [#633](https://github.com/tenzir/vast/pull/633)

- 🎁 The `import pcap` command now takes an optional snapshot length via
  `--snaplen`.  If the snapshot length is set to snaplen, and snaplen is less
  than the size of a packet that is captured, only the first snaplen bytes of
  that packet will be captured and provided as packet data.
  [#642](https://github.com/tenzir/vast/pull/642)

- 🔄 The `import pcap` command no longer takes interface names via `--read,-r`,
  but instead from a separate option named `--interface,-i`. This change has
  been made for consistency with other tools.
  [#641](https://github.com/tenzir/vast/pull/641)

## [0.2] - 2019-10-30

- 🎁 The default schema for Suricata has been updated to support the new
  `suricata.smtp` event type in Suricata 5.

- 🎁 The `export null` command retrieves data, but never prints anything. Its
  main purpose is to make benchmarking VAST easier and faster.

- 🔄 The query language has been extended to support expression of the form
  `X == /pattern/`, where `X` is a compatible LHS extractor. Previously,
  patterns only supports the match operator `~`. The two operators have the
  same semantics when one operand is a pattern.

- 🎁 The new `pivot` command retrieves data of a related type. It inspects each
  event in a query result to find an event of the requested type. If a common
  field exists in the schema definition of the requested type, VAST will
  dynamically create a new query to fetch the contextual data according to the
  type relationship. For example, if two records `T` and `U` share the same
  field `x`, and the user requests to pivot via `T.x == 42`, then VAST will
  fetch all data for `U.x == 42`. An example use case would be to pivot from a
  Zeek or Suricata log entry to the corresponding PCAP packets.
  VAST uses the field `community_id` to pivot between the logs and the packets.
  Pivoting is currently implemented for Suricata, Zeek (with [community ID
  computation](https://github.com/corelight/bro-community-id) enabled), and
  PCAP.

- 🎁 The new `infer` command performs schema inference of input data. The
  command can deduce the input format and creates a schema definition that is
  sutable to use with the supplied data. Supported input types include Zeek TSV
  and JSONLD.

- 🐞 The user environments `LDFLAGS` were erroneously passed to `ar`. Instead,
  the user environments `ARFLAGS` are now used.

- 🐞 Exporting data with `export -n <count>` crashed when `count` was a
  multiple of the table slice size. The command now works as expected.

- 🎁 The newly added `count` comman allows counting hits for a query without
  exporting data.

- 🎁 Commands now support a `--documentation` option, which returns
  Markdown-formatted documentation text.

- 🔄 CAF and Broker are no longer required to be installed prior to building
  VAST. These dependencies are now tracked as git submodules to ensure version
  compatibility. Specifying a custom build is still possible via the CMake
  variables `CAF_ROOT_DIR` and `BROKER_ROOT_DIR`.

- 🔄 When exporting data in `pcap` format, it is no longer necessary to
  manually restrict the query by adding the predicate `#type == "pcap.packet"`
  to the expression. This now happens automatically because only this type
  contains the raw packet data.

- 🐞 Queries of the form `#type ~ /pattern/` used to be rejected erroneously.
  The validation code has been corrected and such queries are now working
  as expected.

- 🐞 When specifying `enum` types in the schema, ingestion failed because there
  did not exist an implementation for such types. It is now possible to use
  define enumerations in schema as expected and query them as strings.

- 🐞 Queries with the less `<` or greater `>` operators produced off-by-one
  results for the `duration` when the query contained a finer resolution than
  the index. The operator now works as expected.

- 🎁 A new schema for Argus CSV output has been added. It parses the output of
  `ra(1)`, which produces CSV output when invoked with `-L 0 -c ,`.

- 🔄 When defining schema attributes in key-value pair form, the value no
  longer requires double-quotes. For example, `#foo=x` is now the same as
  `#foo="x"`. The form without double-quotes consumes the input until the next
  space and does not support escaping. In case an attribute value contains
  whitespace, double-quotes must be provided, e.g., `#foo="x y z"`.

- 🎁 The schema language now supports comments. A double-slash (`//`) begins a
  comment. Comments last until the end of the line, i.e., until a newline
  character (`\n`).

- 🔄 The PCAP packet type gained the additional field `community_id` that
  contains the [Community ID](https://github.com/corelight/community-id-spec)
  flow hash. This identifier facilitates pivoting to a specific flow from data
  sources with connnection-level information, such Zeek or Suricata logs.

- 🐞 Timestamps were always printed in millisecond resolution, which lead to
  loss of precision when the internal representation had a higher resolution.
  Timestamps are now rendered up to nanosecond resolution - the maximum
  resolution supported.

- 🎁 The `import` command now supports CSV formatted data. The type for each
  column is automatically derived by matching the column names from the CSV
  header in the input with the available types from the schema definitions.

- 🐞 All query expressions in the form `#type != X` were falsely evaluated as
  `#type == X` and consequently produced wrong results. These expressions now
  behave as expected.

- 🐞 Parsers for reading log input that relied on recursive rules leaked memory
  by creating cycling references. All recursive parsers have been updated to
  break such cycles and thus no longer leak memory.

- 🔄 Log files generally have some notion of timestamp for recorded events. To
  make the query language more intuitive, the syntax for querying time points
  thus changed from `#time` to `#timestamp`. For example,
  `#time > 2019-07-02+12:00:00` now reads `#timestamp > 2019-07-02+12:00:00`.

- 🎁 Configuring how much status information gets printed to STDERR previously
  required obscure config settings. From now on, users can simply use
  `--verbosity=<level>,-v <level>`, where `<level>` is one of `quiet`, `error`,
  `warn`, `info`, `debug`, or `trace`. However, `debug` and `trace` are only
  available for debug builds (otherwise they fall back to log level `info`).

- 🎁 The query expression language now supports *data predicates*, which are a
  shorthand for a type extractor in combination with an equality operator. For
  example, the data predicate `6.6.6.6` is the same as `:addr == 6.6.6.6`.

- 🐞 The Zeek reader failed upon encountering logs with a `double` column, as
  it occurs in `capture_loss.log`. The Zeek parser generator has been fixed to
  handle such types correctly.

- 🐞 Some queries returned duplicate events because the archive did not filter
  the result set properly. This no longer occurs after fixing the table slice
  filtering logic.

- 🎁 The `index` object in the output from `vast status` has a new field
  `statistics` for a high-level summary of the indexed data. Currently, there
  exists a nested `layouts` objects with per-layout statistics about the number
  of events indexed.

- 🎁 The `accountant` object in the output from `vast status` has a new field
  `log-file` that points to the filesystem path of the accountant log file.

- 🔄 Default schema definitions for certain `import` formats changed from
  hard-coded to runtime-evaluated. The default location of the schema
  definition files is `$(dirname vast-executable)`/../share/vast/schema.
  Currently this is used for the Suricata JSON log reader.

- 🔄 The default directory name for persistent state changed from `vast` to
  `vast.db`. This makes it possible to run `./vast` in the current directory
  without having to specify a different state directory on the command line.

- 🔄 Nested types are from now on accessed by the `.`-syntax. This means
  VAST now has a unified syntax to select nested types and fields.
  For example, what used to be `zeek::http` is now just `zeek.http`.

- 🎁 Data extractors in the query language can now contain a type prefix.
  This enables an easier way to extract data from a specific type. For example,
  a query to look for Zeek conn log entries with responder IP address 1.2.3.4
  had to be written with two terms, `#type == zeek.conn && id.resp_h == 1.2.3.4`,
  because the nested id record can occur in other types as well. Such queries
  can now written more tersely as `zeek.conn.id.resp_h == 1.2.3.4`.

- 🎁 VAST gained support for importing Suricata JSON logs. The import command
  has a new suricata format that can ingest EVE JSON output.

- 🎁 The data parser now supports `count` and `integer` values according to the
  *International System for Units (SI)*. For example, `1k` is equal to `1000`
  and `1Ki` equal to `1024`.

- 🐞 The `map` data parser did not parse negative values correctly. It was not
  possible to parse strings of the form `"{-42 -> T}"` because the parser
  attempted to parse the token for the empty map `"{-}"` instead.

- 🎁 VAST can now ingest JSON data. The `import` command gained the `json`
  format, which allows for parsing line-delimited JSON (LDJSON) according to a
  user-selected type with `--type`. The `--schema` or `--schema-file` options
  can be used in conjunction to supply custom types. The JSON objects in
  the input must match the selected type, that is, the keys of the JSON object
  must be equal to the record field names and the object values must be
  convertible to the record field types.

- 🐞 The CSV printer of the `export` command used to insert 2 superfluous
  fields when formatting an event: The internal event ID and a deprecated
  internal timestamp value. Both fields have been removed from the output,
  bringing it into line with the other output formats.

- 🔄 The (internal) option `--node` for the `import` and `export` commands
  has been renamed from `-n` to `-N`, to allow usage of `-n` for
  `--max-events`.

- 🎁 For symmetry to the `export` command, the `import` command gained the
  `--max-events,n` option to limit the number of events that will be imported.

- 🔄 To make the export option to limit the number of events to be exported
  more idiomatic, it has been renamed from `--events,e` to `--max-events,n`.
  Now `vast export -n 42` generates at most 42 events.

- 🐞 When a node terminates during an import, the client process remained
  unaffected and kept processing input. Now the client terminates when a
  remote node terminates.

- 🎁 The `import` command gained the `--listen,l` option to receive input
  from the network. Currently only UDP is supported. Previously, one had to use
  a clever netcat pipe with enough receive buffer to achieve the same effect,
  e.g., `nc -I 1500 -p 4200 | vast import pcap`. Now this pipe degenerates to
  `vast import pcap -l`.

- 🎁 The new `--disable-accounting` option shuts off periodic gathering of
  system telemetry in the accountant actor. This also disables output in the
  `accounting.log`.

- 🐞 Evaluation of predicates with negations return incorrect results. For
  example, the expression `:addr !in 10.0.0.0/8` created a disjunction of all
  fields to which `:addr` resolved, without properly applying De-Morgan. The
  same bug also existed for key extractors. De-Morgan is now applied properly
  for the operations `!in` and `!~`.
